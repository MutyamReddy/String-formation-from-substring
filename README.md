# String-formation-from-substringGiven a string ‘str’, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.  For example "abab" can be created by appending "ab" to "ab", but "abac" cannot be created by appending a substring to itself.

Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then follows description of testcases. Each case contains a string.


Output:
For each test case, output "True" if it is possible and "False" if not.
 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=Length of String<=1000 
 

Example:
Input:
1
abcabcabc

Output:
True
